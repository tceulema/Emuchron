# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Test the fill circle inverse functionality
#
# NOTE: Due to graphics speed limitations use either the glut device
# (recommended) or the ncurses device, but NOT both or be prepared
# to see lots of graphic glitches. Even if you do use only the glut or
# ncurses lcd device you may still see some occasional graphic glitch.
# Don't adjust your tv set for this, it's just the way ncurses works
# and how the glut lcd device is implemented.
