# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Use repeat loops to quickly skip through the time of a day and see
# how a clock redraws itself
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
# - Set the minute step using variable 's'
# - Set the wait delay between timestamps using variable 'w'
#
# Usage example (with analog HM, minute step 1 and delay of 50 msec):
# cs 3
# vs s=1
# vs w=50
# e s ../script/time-hm.txt
#

wts
# Repeat h(our) between 0..23
rf h=0 h<24 h=h+1
  # Repeat m(inute) between 0..59 with step 's'
  rf m=0 m<60 m=m+s
    # Change the time using the 'h' and 'm' variables
    # This will update the layout of the selected clock
    ts h m 30
    # Wait remainder of 'w'*0.001 seconds since last wts or wte call
    wte w
  # Next m(inute)
  rn
# Next h(our)
rn
