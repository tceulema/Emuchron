# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Test the fill circle inverse functionality
#
# Show filled circles with patterns generated by inversing a pre-filled circle
# with increasing draw radius. Not really useful, but the resulting patterns
# look nice.

hm Pattern 1 using a half filled circle as a base
le
pcf 64 31 31 1
rf radius=0 radius<32 radius=radius+1
  wte 75
  pcf 64 31 radius 4
rn
w 0

hm
hm Pattern 2 using an upward third filled circle as a base
le
pcf 64 31 31 2
rf radius=0 radius<32 radius=radius+1
  wte 75
  pcf 64 31 radius 4
rn
w 0

hm
hm Pattern 3 using a downward third filled circle as a base
hm Note: Result looks like pattern 2 but is actually quite different
le
pcf 64 31 31 3
rf radius=0 radius<32 radius=radius+1
  wte 75
  pcf 64 31 radius 4
