pa f 1 1 5x5p h 1 1 Examples 'pn' format strings:

# In general, if the format is too small to fit the number to be printed,
# the size of the field will be expanded to make it fit.

# 1) Full number with default 6 decimal point digits
pn f 1 8 5x5p h 1 1 123.456 1) %f

# 2) In total 6 characters (including the .) of which 1 decimal point digit
# that may be rounded. In case the number requires less than 6 digits, prefix
# the number with '0' characters to make a total of 6 characters.
pn f 1 14 5x5p h 1 1 123.456 2) %06.1f

# 3) In total 6 characters (including the .) of which 2 decimal point digits.
# In case the number requires less than 6 characters, prefix with space
# characters (which does not apply here).
pn f 1 20 5x5p h 1 1 123.456 3) %6.2f

# 4) In total 4 characters and no decimal point digits. In case the number
# requires less than 4 characters, prefix with space characters (in this case
# 1 space).

# 5) Full number without decimal point digits
pn f 1 32 5x5p h 1 1 1.23456e7 5) %.0f

# 6) Full number with 3 decimal point digits in exponential format
pn f 1 38 5x5p h 1 1 1.2345678e7 6) %.3e

# 7) Let %g decide what should be the best format for this number
pn f 1 44 5x5p h 1 1 1.2345678e7 7) %g

# 8) Let %g decide what should be the best format for this number
pn f 1 50 5x5p h 1 1 123.45678 8) %g
