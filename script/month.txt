# This script is being used by script year.txt to browse quickly through all
# days of an entire year.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
# - Select a year using variable 'y'
# - Select a month using variable 'm'
# - Select the number of days in the month using variable 'd'
# - Set the wait delay between dates using variable 'w'
#
# Usage example (with digital HMS for 31 days in Jan 2012):
# cs 4
# vs y=12
# vs m=1
# vs d=31
# vs w=250
# e s ../script/month.txt
