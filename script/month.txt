# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Skip through all days in a month and see how a clock
#          redraws itself
#
# This script is being used by script year.txt to browse quickly
# through all days of an entire year.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
# - Select a year using variable 'y'
# - Select a month using variable 'm'
# - Select the number of days in the month using variable 'd'
# - Set the wait delay between dates using variable 'w'
#
# Usage example (with digital HMS for 31 days in Jan 2012):
# cs 1
# vs y 12
# vs m 1
# vs d 31
# vs w 25
# e s ../script/month.txt
#

rw dr <= d 1 1
  ts 22 09 30
  ds dr m y
  w w
rn
