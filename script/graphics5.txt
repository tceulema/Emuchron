# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Test glcdBitmap()
#
# Note: This script was used to create the logic for the wave clock in wave.c
# [firmware/clock]. However, upon testing this logic on the actual Monochron
# it turned out the algorithm was too slow as it required too much interaction
# with the lcd controllers. Thererfore, the actual wave clock does not rely on
# glcdBitmap(), but instead implements its own dedicated and optimized logic to
# minimize interaction with the lcd controllers.

# First load the bitmap file we're going to use
gf 0 d ../script/bitmap/abcdefghij.txt
# As we know that the bitmap file contains an image we can also use the
# following command instead:
# gfi 0 d width height ../script/bitmap/abcdefghij.txt

# Show buffer info and help message
