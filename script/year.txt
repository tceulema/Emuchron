# Purpose: Skip through all days in a year and see how a clock redrws itself

# Usage example (with analog HMS, wait delay of 0.25 sec):
# cs 2
# vs w=250
# e s ../script/year.txt
#

# Set date on a leap year (so we have 29 days in feb)
vs y=12

# Make sure we're seeing a date by switching off the alarm
