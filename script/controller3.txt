# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Test the controller stub by inverting the lcd using only controller
# commands
#

# Repeat for both controllers
rf ctrl=0 ctrl<2 ctrl=ctrl+1
  # Set the active lcd controller
  lcs ctrl
  # A controller has 64 x columns...
  rf x=0 x<64 x=x+1
    # ... and 8 vertical y bytes of 8 pixels each
    rf y=0 y<8 y=y+1
      # Set cursor in controller lcd and read its contents.
      # In a sequence of reads in a controller the first byte must be read
      # twice. Upon the second read the byte is properly read and the
      # controller x cursor is incremented.
      # Weird? Yes, but that's how the controller hardware works.
      lxs x
      lys y
      lr myLcdByte
      lr myLcdByte

      # Set the cursor back to where we came from and write the inverted byte
      # back to the lcd
      lxs x
      lys y
      lw ~myLcdByte&0xff
