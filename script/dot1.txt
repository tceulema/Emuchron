#
# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Test the random generator function by drawing random dots resulting
# in a good old fashioned static tv signal image
#
# Notes on using function rand(x)
#  x>=1    : seed the generator with x and return first random number (not used
#            in this script)
#  x=0     : seed the generator with system time (making it a random seed) and
#            return first random number
#  <empty> : return next random number
# The random number returned is between 0 and 1.
#
# Note: Only use this script in combination with the glut lcd device. The
# ncurses device is simply not fast enough to cope with the large number of
# screen updates. It'll work but it just gives a poor UI experience.
#

# Show message and reset statistics.
# Note: After quiting the script use 'sp' to print statistics so we can see how
# many read/write/cursor actions were made, as well as how the emulated lcd
# controllers and glut lcd device did.
