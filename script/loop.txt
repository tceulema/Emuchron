# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Consider this a performance test for the interpreter/CPU by running
#          a time consuming loop.
#          Run this test a few times to average out the result duration.
#          On a decent Intel VM machine this script takes about 13 secs to run.
