# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Consider this a performance test for the interpreter/CPU by running
# a time consuming loop.
# Run this test a few times to average out the result duration.
# On a decent Intel VM machine this script takes about 14 secs to run.
#

hm -- wait for the script to complete or abort with 'q' --

# Clear variables
vr .

# Loop 8 million times
rf x=0 x<8000000 x=x+1
  # Comments

rn

# Print resulting variables
# Values reported must be 8*10^6 for both x and y
hm Variables x and y:
