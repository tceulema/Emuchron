# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Use repeat loop to quickly skip through the minutes of one hour and
# see how how a clock redraws itself
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
#
# Usage example (with analog HM):
# cs 3
# e s ../script/minutes.txt
#

# Make sure alarm will not trigger
tap 0

# Start a wait timer
wts

# Repeat m(inute) between 0..59
rf m=0 m<60 m=m+1
  # Change the time using the 'm' variable
  # This will update the layout of the selected clock
  ts 16 m 0
  # Let the wait timer expire after 0.2 second and start a new one
  wte 200
