# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose:
# Use repeat loops to quickly skip through the alarm times of a day
# and see how a clock redraws itself
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
# - Set the minute step using variable 's'
# - Set the wait delay between alarm times using variable 'w'
#
# Usage example (with analog HM, minute step 1 and delay of 30 msec):
# cs 4
# vs s=1
# vs w=30
# e s ../script/alarm.txt
#

# Make sure we'll be seeing the alarm time
ap 1

# Repeat h(our) between 0..23
rf h=0 h<24 h=h+1
  # Repeat m(inute) between 0..59 with step 's'
  rf m=0 m<60 m=m+s
    # Set a time so the alarm will not fire
    ts 22 9 30
    # Change the alarm using the 'h' and 'm' variables
    # This will update the layout of the selected clock
    as h m
    # Wait 'w'*0.01 second
    w w
  # Next m(inute)
  rn
# Next h(our)
