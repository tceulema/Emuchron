# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Use repeat loops to quickly skip through one hour and see
#          how a clock redraws itself
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Select a clock (if not selected there's no visual feedback)
# - Set the second step using variable 's'
# - Set the wait delay between timestamps using variable 'w'
#
# Usage example (with digital HMS, second step 1 and delay of 40 msec):
# cs 11
# vs s=1
# vs w=40
# e s ../script/time-ms.txt
#

wts
# Repeat m(inute) between 0..59
rf m=0 m<60 m=m+1
  # Repeat s(econd) between 0..59 step 5
  rf x=0 x<60 x=x+s
    # Change the time using the 'm' and 'x' variables
    # This will update the selected clock
    ts 12 m x
    # Wait 'w'*0.001 seconds
    wte w
  # Next x second
  rn
# Next m(inute)
