# Test command script for the Monochron emulator
#
# Purpose: Draw a bunch of circles using only integer math. This script
# replicates the base of such drawing logic in Emuchron scripting language.
# Why? Because we can! It also helps in understanding the draw logic and
# testing out optimizations prior to implementing them in the actual function
# in glcd.c.
# The glcdCircle2() code logic is a bit more advanced as it only calculates
# the right side of the circle and then mirrors it to the left side, with both
# sides using the glcdBuffer[] array, thereby improving the drawing speed.
#
# This demo runs continuously.
# Quit the demo by pressing the 'q' key.
