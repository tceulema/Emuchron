// The tone and beat data is based on the following cute Arduino project:

//
// The Arduino firmware stores the 295 notes as a char array and maps each note
// to a tone via a linear search algorithm in two other arrays. This is
// considered too CPU intensive as our code runs in a 1 msec interrupt handler.
// So, we are going to store the notes as tones. Two things need to be taken
// care of.
// First, the Monochron piezo is not able to properly reproduce low frequency
// tones. We have to add one octave to the original tones to make the audio
// audible anyway.
// Second, we need tones over the 255 Hz range, and to be able to store these
// values we need 16 bit integers. To reduce the data space footprint we want
// to put a tone in a single byte.
// To meet both challenges, a Mario note from the Arduino firmware is converted
// into a base tone and is increased 1 octave. To allow storing the resulting
// tone in a single byte it is divided by MAR_TONEFACTOR. The densed tone value
// is rounded upwards or downwards to minimize the delta upon reproducing its
// value. This means that a reproduced tone (= tone * MAR_TONEFACTOR) is off by
// at most MAR_TONEFACTOR / 2 = +/-4 Hz.
// Since the quality of the piezo speaker in Monochron is worse than miserable,
// this 4 Hz delta sounds (pun intended) acceptable to me.
//
// Then there's the following. The Mario tune partly consists of repeated
// sequences of tones+durations. By cutting out the redundancy we can reduce
// the size of the tones+durations arrays. So, instead of 295 bytes for the
// entire tune we can cut it back to 10 unique tone+duration sequences
// requiring only 150 bytes. By applying this approach on both the tone and
// durations arrays below we'll save a total of 290 data bytes. A nice side
// effect of this is that because the array size is now less than 255 elements
// we now can use uint8_t array indices instead of uint16_t indices, leading to
// a substantial save in generated object code. The downside of this is that we
// need a master table that defines the sequence of unique tones+durations sets
// to be played, and that the logic to play these sets becomes slightly more
// complicated. But, these extra costs are outweighed by the savings reached by
// no longer needing the linear search arrays in the firmware.
// All in all, by cutting out the data redundancy, we save an additional ~225
// bytes on the image size, free to be used by clock code.
//
// Note: Each byte in MarioTones[] must have a corresponding byte in
//       MarioBeats[].

// The Arduino firmware stores the 295 beats as floats, which is 4 bytes per

// us CPU expensive floating point arithmetic and lots of data space. And, as
// noted above, by cutting out data redundancy as well, instead of 1180 data
// bytes (295 floats) we'll only need 150. Nice!
// Concerning inaccuracies in reproducing durations, here's the worst-case
// scenario: When in the Arduino data a beat duration 1.3 is used this leads to
// a duration of 1.3 * MAR_TEMPO = 123 msec. Our implementation for the same
// beat in a byte will lead to a duration of 4 * MAR_TEMPO / MAR_BEATFACTOR =

// The Mario tune partly consists of repeated sets of tones with play duration.

// - The first byte is the index in the tones+duration arrays for the line to
